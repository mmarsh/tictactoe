tic tac toe
====================

js implementation of a basic game tree for 
tic tac toe, as well as a min max algorithm to 
select the right move for the ai to perform.

also contains a simple ui as a proof of concept

deployment
--------------------
just dump the contents of the app directory in a basic web host.
I used [mongoose](http://code.google.com/p/mongoose/) when developing

TODO
--------------------
test files are woefully lacking. Didn't really TDD much 
besides the board win state logic. Need to remedy that.
